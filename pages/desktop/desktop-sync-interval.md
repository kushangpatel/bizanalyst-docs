## Sync Interval
By default Biz Analyst checks for any changes in your **&quot;Tally ERP 9&quot;** data every 5 minutes. You may change this frequency as per your usage. If data is not changed or added often in your **Tally ERP 9** then you may increase the sync frequency. If data is changed or added very frequently then decrease the sync frequency so that you get the latest changes on your phone quickly.

To change the **Sync Frequency**, click **Settings** on the top blue bar, then click **Sync** from the left side, change the frequency minutes and click **Save** button.
